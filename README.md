# Prominence_Oscillation_SRFP
# These codes are developed by Panchajanya Dey, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
# as a part of the SRFP project prominence oscillation in solar corona funded by Indian Academy of Science (2023)
# this folder contains the codes are for downloading the necessary fits files, modifying them by multi-gaussian image processing
# and creating an animation that helps to identify the location of the prominence oscillation
# the next part is to determine the pixel coordinates and creating a 4-pixel wide slit and get the corresponding XT map
# which is also covered in this project
# finally handpicking the prominence oscillation from the XT map and fitting it to a damped harmonic oscillation is done
# the final result is the period, damping time and amplitude determination for a LAL prominence oscillation
# I thank Prof. Vaibhav Pant (ARIES) and his group member Upasna Baweja (ARIES) for helping me throughout the project
# and clearing my doubts
# for comments, suggestions and clarity regarding the code contact at the following email address
# panchajanyad@iisc.ac.in
# many parts of this code are written in such a way that if the code is stopped in between and then run again, it will start from exactly where it has stopped
# so that the same part does not need to run again 
# to reduce time usage
# while using the code be careful about the file_paths as they won't match from device to device, so you need to change them manually
