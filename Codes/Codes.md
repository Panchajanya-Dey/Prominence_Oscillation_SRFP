# These codes are developed by Panchajanya Dey, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
# as a part of the SRFP project prominence oscillation in solar corona funded by Indian Academy of Science (2023)
# this folder contains the codes are for downloading the necessary fits files, modifying them by multi-gaussian image processing
# and creating an animation that helps to identify the location of the prominence oscillation
# the next part is to determine the pixel coordinates and creating a 4-pixel wide slit and get the corresponding XT map
# which is also covered in this project
# finally handpicking the prominence oscillation from the XT map and fitting it to a damped harmonic oscillation is done
# the final result is the period, damping time and amplitude determination for a LAL prominence oscillation
# I thank Prof. Vaibhav Pant (ARIES) and his group member Upasna Baweja (ARIES) for helping me throughout the project
# and clearing my doubts
