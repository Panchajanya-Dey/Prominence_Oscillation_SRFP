    "# These codes are developed by Panchajanya Dey, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore\n",
    "# as a part of the SRFP project prominence oscillation in solar corona funded by Indian Academy of Science (2023)\n",
    "# this folder contains the codes are for downloading the necessary fits files, modifying them by multi-gaussian image processing\n",
    "# and creating an animation that helps to identify the location of the prominence oscillation\n",
    "# the next part is to determine the pixel coordinates and creating a 4-pixel wide slit and get the corresponding XT map\n",
    "# which is also covered in this project\n",
    "# finally handpicking the prominence oscillation from the XT map and fitting it to a damped harmonic oscillation is done\n",
    "# the final result is the period, damping time and amplitude determination for a LAL prominence oscillation\n",
